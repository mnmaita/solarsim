# Solarsim Server

The Solarsim Server is a [Bevy](https://bevy.org/) app that runs the simulation with a fixed timestep and can be remotely controlled through the [Bevy Remote Protocol](https://docs.rs/bevy_remote/latest/bevy_remote/). It renders an interactive UI with controls to alter the simulation parameters.
